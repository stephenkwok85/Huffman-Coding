# Huffman-Coding

An implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm through Java programming.

The Huffman Coding Algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, designed for quick and lossless data transmission.

I utilized trees data structure through the incorporation of queues and ArrayLists data structures to maximize efficiency in code runtime and memory usage in programming.
